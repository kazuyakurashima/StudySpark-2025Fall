## Summary

Found two regressions: encouragements are never marked as read anymore, and parent status generation now drops the latest reflection text because it still reads the old `summary` field.

## Remaining Issues

Total: 2 issue(s)

| # | File | Line | Severity | Message |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `app/actions/encouragement.ts` | 1084 | error | `markEncouragementAsRead` now only updates `read_at` and never sets `is_read` to true. Messages that were previously unread will continue to be treated as unread forever, defeating the read-status feature. |
| 2 | `app/api/cron/generate-parent-status/route.ts` | 164 | error | After switching the source of `recentReflection` to `coaching_sessions` and selecting `summary_text`, the code still reads `recentReflection?.summary`. The property is always undefined, so parent status messages never include the latest reflection text even when it exists. |

## Action Required

Max rounds (3) reached without approval.
Fix the remaining issues above, `git add`, and re-run from round 1.
